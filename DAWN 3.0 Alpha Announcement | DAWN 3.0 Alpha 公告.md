> As many in the EOS.IO development community are aware, we’ve been working since December on merging two lines of development, Dawn 2.x and Dawn 3.0.As many in the EOS.IO development community are aware, we’ve been working since December on merging two lines of development, Dawn 2.x and Dawn 3.0. The merged code base is now stable enough to make public as an Early Alpha and will now become our Github master branch. The prior master will be renamed “dawn-2.x” and will continue to be available as a non-master branch.

正如EOS.IO的开发者社区意识到的，我们在12月将开发的两条分支：黎明2.x 和 黎明3.0.合并的代码已经足够稳定，可以作为早期公测Alpha版本，并将变为Github上的主分支。先前的主分支将被重命名的“dawn-2.x”(黎明2.x),将继续以非主分支的形式存在。

> Community developers will notice that the next time they “git pull” from Master, they will obtain the new Dawn 3.0 code. Those wishing to continue to pull the Dawn 2.x code that connects to the current TestNet can do so by following instructions in the new readme.md, being made available at the same time as the re-mastering.

社区开发者在下一步拉取主分支时，他们会意识到得到的将是黎明3.0主分支的代码。现在的测试网络使用的是黎明2.x的代码，在切换主分支时将更新readme.md说明文档,开发者们可以按照新的说明文档中的方法拉取到黎明2.0的代码。

> Please note that the Dawn 3.0 code is still in Early Alpha and is not compatible with the current block.one-provided public TestNet; it will not be available in a public TestNet until the end of Q1 2018. In the interim, developers may create their own testnets with the new Dawn 3.0 code. As a reminder, Dan Larimer and the development team have changed the way we forecast development. This means we won’t be announcing the date for the Dawn 3.0 Testnet until the timeline is close enough for us to have high confidence in its capabilities.
